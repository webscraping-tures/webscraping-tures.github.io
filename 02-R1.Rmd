# R & R Studio {#R1}

## Installing R
*R* is a freely available programming language used predominantly for data 
science and statistical computations. For more information on the language and 
to access the documentation, visit: 
<https://www.r-project.org/>{target="_blank"}. From there you can also follow 
the link to *CRAN*, the *Comprehensive R Archive Network*, or access it directly
by visiting <https://cran.r-project.org/>{target="_blank"}.

The latest versions of R will always be hosted at CRAN. At the top of the 
landing page, you will find links to the installers for each operating system.
If you are using Windows, please choose "base" after following the link and then
download the offered file. In the case of Mac OS download the first file listed
under "Latest release". In both cases, execute the file and install R to a 
directory of your choice. If you are using Linux, the link on CRAN will offer 
installation advice for some of the more popular distributions. In any case, you
can check the package manager of your choice for the latest available release
for your system.

All examples used on this Website were written and tested with R version 4.0.4
"Lost Library Book". While it is not to be expected, they might, nonetheless,
return errors in newer versions of R.


## RStudio

The basic R installation provides a simple GUI -- Graphical User Interface -- 
that could in principle be used to follow the contents of this introduction to
Web Scraping. The widely more common approach is to use an external IDE 
-- Integrated Development Environment --, the most popular being RStudio. 
Using an IDE will dramatically improve your workflow and I would strongly
recommend using RStudio for this purpose.

RStudio is also freely available and can be found at
<https://www.rstudio.com/>{target="_blank"}. Following the "Download" link and
scrolling down (ignoring the different versions offered for professional usage)
you will find the latest installers for several operating systems offered as
downloads. In most cases, simply installing RStudio after R has been installed,
will work "out of the box". 


### Overview
``` {r, echo = FALSE, fig.retina = 1}
include_graphics("rstudio/RStudio.png")
```

The RStudio interface consists of four sub-areas. The bottom-left shows the
"Console" as well as additional tabs which you will rarely need in the
beginning. The console can be used to evaluate R code live. We will begin
working with the console soon, so this will make more sense to you in a bit.
The top-left shows opened files, e.g. R scripts. This is where you will actually
spend most of your time. This introduction proceeds from using one-time commands
in the console to writing your code in scripts that can be re-opened, re-run and
shared. The top-right has several tabs of which "Environment" should be our main
concern at this point. Here you will see all data objects created in your
RStudio session. More on this later. Finally, the bottom-right shows us, amongst
other things, the "Files" in a selected folder, graphical output under "Plots"
and requested "Help" on packages and functions.


## Hello World!
So, let's begin with putting R & RStudio to use. For now, we will write our
commands directly into the console.
You will notice a `>` sign at the beginning of the last line in the console. 
This is a prompt, as in "write commands here". Try writing this and executing
the command with the "Enter" key:

``` {r}
print("Hello World!")
```

You just entered your first R command, received your first output and also used
your first function. We will address functions in more detail later. For now, it
is enough to know that the command `print()` prints everything that is enclosed
in its parentheses to the output. The output begins with `[1]`, indicating that
this is the first, and in this case the only, element of the output generated by
the executed command. Please note, that RStudio will not print `##` before the
output. In the shown code segments on this website, `##` is inserted before the
output to allow copying the code directly to RStudio, as one or mutliple `#`
indicate that a line is a comment, and thus is not evaluated as a command by R.

### Calculating with R

R understands the basic arithmetic symbols `+ - * /` and thus the console can be
used as a calculator. Many functions for more involved calculations, e.g. 
`sqrt()` for taking a square root of the content enclosed in the parenthesis, 
are available. `x^y` can be used to write x to the power of y. For now, you 
should write the code below line for line into the R console and execute each
line with the "Enter" key.

``` {r}
17 + 25
99 - 57
4 * 10.5
84 / 2
sqrt(1764)
6.480741 ^ 2
```

### Comparison operators {#comparison}

We can use comparison operators to compare two values and receive the test
result as output. To test if two values are equal, we write `==`. To test if 
they are not equal, we can use `!=`

``` {r}
42 == 42
42 != 42
```

We can also compare if the first value is less `<`, less or equal `<=`, 
larger `>` or larger or equal `>=`, compared to the second value.

``` {r}
10 < 42
42 <= 42
10 > 42
90 >= 42
```

## Objects
Some of the power of using a language like R for computation, comes from the 
ability to store data or results for later use and further analysis.
In R, all types of data are stored in objects.
On a basic level, an object is a name that we define that has some form of data
assigned to it. To assign data to a name, we use the assignment operator `<-`.

``` {r}
the_answer <- 42
```

A handy keyboard shortcut for writing the assignment operator is pressing the
"Alt" and "-" keys simultaneously. Learning this shortcut early, will safe you
on a lot of typing and keyboard gymnastics.

After we assigned a value to an object, we can recall that value, by writing the
object's name.

``` {r}
the_answer
```

We can also use defined objects in calculations and function calls (more on
those later). Note, that if we assign a value to an already defined object, the
stored value is overwritten by the new one.

``` {r}
the_answer <- the_answer / 2
the_answer

a <- 17
b <- 4
the_answer <- (a + b) * 2
the_answer
```

All objects we define are listed in the "Environment" tab, seen in the upper 
right of RStudio. If we ever want to remove objects from the environment,
we can use the `rm()` function. In general, this is not necessary, but it can
help with keeping the list from getting cluttered.

``` {r}
rm(the_answer)
```


## Vectors

When we assigned a number to an object, we actually created a vector. A vector 
is a one-dimensional data structure that can contain multiple elements. The 
number of elements determine the length of the vector. So a vector with only
one element is still a vector, but with a length of 1.
To assign multiple elements to a vector, we use the combine function `c()`. All
values inside the parentheses, separated by `,`, are combined as elements to 
form the vector.

``` {r}
v <- c(7, 8, 9)

v
```

### Subsetting

If we want to access certain elements of a vector, we have to use subsetting.
This is achieved by adding square brackets to the object's name, containing the
position of the element in its vector. In order to access the first or third
element, we can write:

``` {r}
v[1]
v[3]
```

We can also access multiple elements at once, using `c()` inside the brackets or
by defining a range of positions using `:`.

``` {r}
v[c(1, 3)]
v[2:3]
```

### Types of vectors

Observing the vector `v` we created in the environment, we notice that RStudio
writes `num [1:3]` before listing the values of the elements. The second part,
indicates the length of 3, while the first part shows the type of the vector we
created. In this case the type is *numeric*. Numeric vectors, as you might have
guessed, contain numbers. We can also use `str()` to receive info on type,
length and content of a vector.

``` {r}
str(v)
```

There are a number of other types of vectors, the two most important -- besides 
numeric vectors -- being logical and character vectors.

*Logical* vectors can only contain the values `TRUE` and `FALSE`. Strictly
speaking, they -- as the other types of vectors -- can also contain `NA`, 
indicating a missing value. We will talk more about NAs later on. Logical
vectors are often created when we test for something. For example, we can test, 
if the elements in a numerical vector are larger or equal to 5 and receive a 
logical vector containing the test results.

``` {r}
x <- c(1, 7, 3, 5)
x >= 5
```

*Character* vectors contain *strings* of characters. When assigning strings, 
they have to be enclosed in quotation marks.

``` {r}
char_v <- c("This", "is", "a", "character", "vector!")
```

We can compare character vectors only for (non-)equality, not for being smaller
or larger.

``` {r}
"same" == "same"
"same" == "not the same"
"same" != "not the same"
```

Character vectors also cannot be used to calculate. This can get problematic, if
numbers are stored as characters, which arises frequently when Web Scraping.

``` {r, error=TRUE}
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
b <- c("7", "8", "9")

str(a)
str(b)

a + b
```

As we enclosed the elements of vector `b` in quotation marks, R interprets the
data as characters instead of numbers. Since characters cannot be used for
calculations, we received an error message. But we can make R interpret the
characters as numbers by using `as.numeric()`.

``` {r}
a + as.numeric(b)
```


### A brief look at lists

Note that a vector of a certain type, can only contain elements of that type. So
we cannot mix data types in the same vector. If we want to mix data types, we
can use lists instead of vectors.

``` {r}
l <-list(1, TRUE, "Hello World!")
str(l)
```

Lists can also contain other lists to represent hierarchical data structures.
We will see lists "in action" later on in this course.


## Functions

Functions provide an easy and concise way of performing more or less complex
tasks using predefined bits of R code that are provided in "base R" -- i.e.
that come with the basic R installation -- or in the various additional packages
that are available for installation.  We have already used a number of functions
up to this point, e.g. `print()`.  To "call" a function, we write its name,
followed by parentheses. Inside the parentheses additional arguments are
provided to R. In most cases, some data has to be entered as the first
argument. For example, `print()` writes the text provided as argument to the
output. More complex functions often allow for more than one argument. Sometimes
these are required, but more often these additional arguments are optional and
can be used to change some options from the default value to the one desired.

### Help

But how do we know which arguments can or have to be provide to use a function
and what their effects are? We can check the documentation on CRAN or use Google
to find additional information. Another often more convenient way, is to use the
help functionality build into R. By writing `?` in front of the function name
into the console and executing the line by pressing "Enter", the help file is 
opened in the lower right of the RStudio window. Let's try this for the
function `rnorm()`. 

``` {r}
?rnorm()
```

The help file tells us several things. `rnorm()` is part of a family of
functions that are related to the normal distribution, each providing a distinct
functionality. The functionality of `rnorm()` being the generation of random
numbers stemming from the normal distribution. We also learn, that three
arguments can be provided. `n`, the number of observations to be generated, as
well as `mean` and `sd`, the mean and the standard deviation of the normal
distribution to be drawn from. We also see that `mean` and `sd` are provided
with the standard values 0 and 1 respectively, indicated by the `=`. We also see
that `n` has no standard value. So we have to provide a value for `n`, but not
for `mean` and `sd`. Just writing `rnorm()` will result in an error.

``` {r, error=TRUE}
rnorm()
```

To provide an argument to a function, we write the name of the argument,
followed by `=` and the value to be provided. Note that, since `rnorm()` draws
random numbers, your output will differ from the output presented here.

``` {r}
rnorm(n = 10)
```

In the same vein, additional arguments that are allowed by the function can 
be defined, instead of using their default values.

``` {r}
rnorm(n = 10, mean = 10, sd = 0.5)
```

We can also skip writing the names of arguments in many cases. As the `n` 
argument is the first listed in the function's parentheses, R also understands
the call, if we just provide the value to be used as the first argument. You 
will often encounter the convention that the first argument is written without
its name and any further arguments are written in full.

``` {r}
rnorm(10, mean = 10, sd = 0.5)
```

### Examples: Basic statistical functions

Base R provides us with some basic statistical functions that are used for
data analysis.

We should start with defining a numerical vector that contains some data to be
analysed.

``` {r}
data <- c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42)
```

We could be interested in describing this data by its arithmetic mean, median 
and standard deviation. For this purpose we can use the functions `mean()`, 
`median()`, and `sd()` provided by base R. All three do not require additional
arguments besides the data to be analysed which we can provide using the 
object `data` we created beforehand.

``` {r}
mean(data)
median(data)
sd(data)
```


## If/Else statements
Often we want to write code that reacts to the value of a certain object and 
thus "decides" by itself which action to perform, based on this value. To 
achieve this, we can use *conditional execution* by using `if` and `else` 
statements. The basic syntax look as follows:

```
if (condition) {
  code to be executed when the condition is TRUE
} else {
  code to be executed when the condition is FALSE
}
```

`if` and `else` are both followed by `{}`, which enclose the code to be
executed. While it is not strictly necessary to stretch the code over multiple
lines, I would highly recommend doing this. It increases readability of your
code for yourself and anyone you share it with, which makes it easier to
understand and also makes it easier to spot mistakes and correct them. For the
same reasons, it is also recommended to indent the code to be executed.

Conditions are created by applying comparison operators, like `==`, `<`, `>`, 
`!=` and so on. Thus the condition compares two values and returns `TRUE` if the
condition is met, and `FALSE` if it is not met. When the condition for the `if`
statement is `TRUE`, the code between the `{}` following it is executed. If it
is `FALSE`, the code between the `{}` following the `else` statement is
executed instead.

``` {r}
x <- 42

if (x == 42) {
  print("This is the answer")
} else {
  print("This is not the answer")
}

x <- 24

if (x == 42) {
  print("This is the answer")
} else {
  print("This is not the answer")
}
```

In the code above, we first asign a value to the object `x` and follow this with
an `if` statement that checks if the value equals `42` and returns a string to
the console, indicating if the condition was met or not.

We can also chain multiple `if` and `else` statements to create more complex
decisions. While it is possible to chain a high number of statements in this
way, it is not recommended to overuse this technique. The code will get long,
hard to understand and thus mistakes get more likely.

To chain statements, we use `else if` statements after the first `if` and before
the last `else`. The basic syntac stays the same. Contemplate the example below.

``` {r}
x <- 42

if (x == 42) {
  print("This is the answer")
} else if (x < 42) {
  print("The value is too low to be the answer")
} else {
  print("The value is too high to be the answer")
}

x <- 24

if (x == 42) {
  print("This is the answer")
} else if (x < 42) {
  print("The value is to low to be the answer")
} else {
  print("The value is to high to be the answer")
}

x <- 84

if (x == 42) {
  print("This is the answer")
} else if (x < 42) {
  print("The value is to low to be the answer")
} else {
  print("The value is to high to be the answer")
}
```

In the first case, the `if` condition is met and the code following the `if`
statement is executed. In the second case, the `if` condition is not met, so the
code checks if the condition for the `else if` statement is `TRUE`. It is in
this case, so the code following it is executed. In the third case, both
conditions return `FALSE` and thus the code following the `else` statement is
run.

We can also combine conditions by applying *logical operators* to create more
complex conditions. `&&` -- *AND* -- checks if both conditions combined by it
are `TRUE` and only returns `TRUE` if both are at the same time. `||` -- *OR* --
checks if at least on of the conditions is `TRUE` and returns `TRUE` if one or 
both are. When combining two conditions, we thus have these possibilities:

* `TRUE && TRUE` returns `TRUE`
* `TRUE && FALSE`, `FALSE && TRUE` and `FALSE && FALSE` all return `FALSE`
* `TRUE || TRUE`, `TRUE || FALSE` and `FALSE || TRUE` all return `TRUE`
* `FALSE || FALSE` returns `FALSE`

In most cases, you could also use single `&` and `|` operators, to combine
conditions. `&&` and `||` are the safer alternatives, as they always return a
single `TRUE` or `FALSE` and `if` statements can not interpret a logical vector
containing multiple values. `&` and `|` can return such a vector if at least
one object used for comparison is a vector of a length longer than 1. For more
details on this, you can read the corresponding chapter in "R for Data Science"
by Wickham & Grolemund:
<https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html#conditional-execution>{target="_blank"}.

``` {r}
x <- 42
y <- 42

if (x == 42 && y == 42) {
  print("Both x and y are the answer")
} else {
  print("At least one of x and y is not the answer")
}

x <- 42
y <- 24

if (x == 42 && y == 42) {
  print("Both x and y are the answer")
} else {
  print("At least one of x and y is not the answer")
}

x <- 42
y <- 24

if (x == 42 || y == 42) {
  print("At least one of x and y is the answer")
} else {
  print("Both x and y are not the answer")
}


x <- 12
y <- 24

if (x == 42 || y == 42) {
  print("At least one of x and y is the answer")
} else {
  print("Both x and y are not the answer")
}
```

We can use combined conditions and chaining to create more complex decisions.
But be wary to not overuse both techniques, for the same reasons as stated
above.

``` {r}
x <- 42
y <- 42

if (x == 42 && y == 42) {
  print("Both x and y are the answer")
} else if (x == 42) {
  print("x is the answer")
} else if (y == 42) {
  print("y is the answer")
} else {
  print("Both x and y are not the answer")
}

x <- 42
y <- 24

if (x == 42 && y == 42) {
  print("Both x and y are the answer")
} else if (x == 42) {
  print("x is the answer")
} else if (y == 42) {
  print("y is the answer")
} else {
  print("Both x and y are not the answer")
}

x <- 24
y <- 12

if (x == 42 && y == 42) {
  print("Both x and y are the answer")
} else if (x == 42) {
  print("x is the answer")
} else if (y == 42) {
  print("y is the answer")
} else {
  print("Both x and y are not the answer")
}
```

Please note, that the code following the statements can be more complex than the
code used in these introductory examples and can be comprised of anything that
is valid R code. Also, each `{}`can hold multiple lines of code.
