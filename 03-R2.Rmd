## RStudio Workflow

### Settings

## Packages in general

A short note about CRAN: It means "Comprehensive R Archive Network". You already got to know this during the installation of R, but the various R packages, the corresponding documentation and various information are also "hosted" on this website. If you install a package directly from RStudio, it uses CRAN to find and download the package and the associated files.
