## Legality?

* its grey
* german case?


## Responsibility!

* its a privilege and we have to treat it this way to remain a privilege
* robots.txt
* when in doubt, contact the admins
  * or get legal advice is possible
* think about what you really need
* test your code on a small scale

## Good practice

* follow robots.txt
* download only what you need
  * and only once (if possible)
  * example for checking if file is already present
* set waiting times
