# Scraping of multi-page websites {#rvest3}

``` {r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache.path = 'cache/')
```

In many cases, we do not want to scrape the content of a single website, but 
several sub-pages in one step. In this session we will look at two common 
variations. Index pages and pagination.


## Index-pages

An index page, in this context, means a website on which links to the various 
sub-pages are listed. We can imagine this as a kind of table of contents.

The website for the tidyverse packages serves as an example: 
<https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/>{target=_"blank"}.
Under the point "Core tidyverse" the eight packages are listed, which are loaded
in R with `library(tidyverse)`. In addition to the name and icon, a short 
description of the package and a link to further information, are part of the 
list.

Let's look at one of the sub-pages for the core packages. Since they all have the
same structure, you can choose any package as an example. It could be our
scraping goal to create a table with the names of the core packages, the current
version number, and the links to CRAN and the matching chapter in "R for Data
Science" by Hadley and Wickham. By now we have all the tools to extract this 
data from the websites. We could now "manually" scrape the individual sub-pages
and merge the data. It would be more practical, however, if we could start from
the index page and scrape all eight sub-pages and the data of interest they
contain in one step. This is exactly what we will look at in the following.


### Scraping of the index

``` {r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

As a first step, we need to extract the links to the sub-pages from the source 
code of the index page. As always, we download the website and parse it.

``` {r}
website <- "https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/" %>% 
  read_html()
```

In this case, the links are stored twice in the source code. In one case the
image of the icon is linked, in the other the name of the package. You can
follow this in the source code and/or with the WDTs yourself by now. However, we
need each link only once. One of several ways to select them could be to select
the `<a>` tags that directly follow the individual `<div class="package">` tags.

``` {r}
a_nodes <- website %>% 
  html_nodes(css = "div.package > a")

a_nodes
```

Since we need the actual URLs to be able to read out the sub-pages in the 
following, we should now extract the values of the `href=""` attributes. 

``` {r}
links <- a_nodes %>%
  html_attr(name = "href")

links
```

### Iteration with map()

Before starting to parse the sub-pages, we must think about how we can get R to
apply these steps automatically to several URLs one after the other. One 
possibility from base R would be to apply a "For Loop". However, I would like to
introduce the `map()` functions family, from the tidyverse package *purrr*. 
These follow the basic logic of the tidyverse, can easily be included in pipes
and have a short and intuitively understandable syntax.

The `map()` function takes a vector or list as input, applies a function 
specified in the second argument to each of the elements of the input, and 
returns to us a list of the results of the applied function.

``` {r}
x <- c(1.28, 1.46, 1.64, 1.82)

map(x, round)
```

For each element of the numerical vector `x`, `map()` individually applies the
function `round()`. `round()` does what the name suggests, and rounds the input 
up or down, depending on the numerical value. As a result, `map()` returns a
list.

If we want to have a vector as output, we can use specific variants of the map 
functions depending on the desired type -- logical, integer, double or 
character. Here is a quote from the help on ?map:

> "map_lgl(), map_int(), map_dbl() and map_chr() return an atomic vector of the
indicated type (or die trying)."

For example, if we want to have a numeric vector instead of a list as output for
the above example, we can use `map_dbl()`:

``` {r}
x <- c(1.28, 1.46, 1.64, 1.82)

map_dbl(x, round)
```

Or for a character vector we can apply `map_chr()`. The function `toupper()`
used here, puts out the input as uppercase letters.

``` {r}
x <- c("abc", "def", "gah")

map_chr(x, toupper)
```

If we want to change further arguments of the applied function, they are 
listed after the name of the function. Here, the number of decimal places to be
rounded is set from the default value of 0 to 1.

``` {r}
x <- c(1.28, 1.46, 1.64, 1.82)

map_dbl(x, round, digits = 1)
```

This gives us an overview of iteration with `map()`, but this can necessarily 
only be a first introduction. For a more detailed introduction to For Loops and
the map functions, I recommend the chapter on "Iteration" from "R for Data
Science":
<https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html>{target="_blank"}

### Scraping the sub-pages

We can now use `map()` to parse all sub-pages in one step. As input, we enter the
character vector that contains the URLs of the sub-pages, and as the function to
be applied, the familiar `read_html()`. For each of the eight URLs, the function
is applied to the respective URL one after the other. As output we get a list of
the eight parsed sub-pages.

``` {r}
pages <- links %>% 
  map(read_html)
```

If we look at the sub-pages in the browser, we can see that the HTML structure is
identical for each sub-page in terms of the information we are interested in --
name, version number and CRAN as well as "R for Data Science" links. We can 
therefore extract the data for each of them using the same CSS selectors.

``` {r}
pages %>% 
  map(html_node, css = "a.navbar-brand") %>% 
  map_chr(html_text)
```

The name of the package is displayed in the menu bar in the upper section of the
pages. This is enclosed by an `<a>` tag. For example, for 
<https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/>{target="_blank"}
this is: `<a class="navbar-brand" href="index.html">ggplot2</a>`. We can
construct a selector in a simple way. One possible option is the one used here.

So what happens in detail in the code shown? The input is the previously created
list with the eight parsed websites. In the second line, by using `map()`, the
function `html_node()` with the argument `css = "a.navbar-brand"` is applied to
each of the parsed pages. For each of the eight pages, the corresponding 
HTML-node is selected in turn. These are passed through the pipe to the third 
line, where iteration is again performed over each node, this time using the
familiar function `html_text()`. For each of the eight selected nodes, the text
between the start and end tag is extracted. Since `map_chr()` is used here, a
character vector is returned as output.

``` {r}
pages %>% 
  map(html_node, css = "span.version.version-default") %>% 
  map_chr(html_text)
```

The extraction of the current version number of the packages works the same way.
For ggplot2, these are contained in the following tag: 
`<span class="version version-default" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Released version">3.3.2</span>`. 
This can also be selected easily, but we see an interesting detail. Namely, the
class name here contains a space. This indicates that the `<span>` tag carries 
both the class `version` and `version-default`. We can select this by attaching
both class names to `span` in the selector with a `.` Strictly speaking, 
however, we do not need to do this here. Both class names by themselves are 
sufficient for selection, as they do not appear anywhere else on the website. 
In terms of the most explicit CSS selectors possible, I would still recommend to 
use both class names, but this is also a matter of taste.

``` {r}
pages %>% 
  map(html_node, css = "ul.list-unstyled > li:nth-child(1) > a") %>% 
  map_chr(html_attr, name = "href")

pages %>% 
  map(html_node, css = "ul.list-unstyled > li:nth-child(4) > a") %>% 
  map_chr(html_attr, name = "href")
```

The extraction of the links also follows the same basic principle. The selector 
is a little more complicated, but can easily be understood using the WDTs. We
select the `<a>` tags of the first and fourth `<li>` children of the unordered 
list of the class `list-unstyled`. Here we apply the function `html_attr()` 
with the argument `name = "href"` to each of the eight selected nodes to get the
data of interest, the URL of the links.

If we are only interested in the final result, we can also extract the data of
the sub-pages directly during the creation of a tibble:

``` {r}
tibble(
  name = pages %>% 
    map(html_node, css = "a.navbar-brand") %>% 
    map_chr(html_text),
  version = pages %>% 
    map(html_node, css = "span.version.version-default") %>% 
    map_chr(html_text),
  CRAN = pages %>% 
    map(html_node, css = "ul.list-unstyled > li:nth-child(1) > a") %>% 
    map_chr(html_attr, name = "href"),
  Learn = pages %>% 
    map(html_node, css = "ul.list-unstyled > li:nth-child(4) > a") %>% 
    map_chr(html_attr, name = "href")
)
```


## Pagination

Another common form of dividing a website into several sub-pages is 
*pagination*. You all know this from everyday life on the internet. We enter a 
search term in Google and get results that are divided over several pages. These
are accessible and navigable via the numbered links and the forward/back arrows
at the bottom of the browser content. This is "pagination in action" and we
encounter similar variants on many websites.

In the press release archive of the website of the Brandenburg state parliament,
pagination is also used to distribute the releases over several sub-pages. To
illustrate the scraping of such a website, we can, for example, aim at scraping
the date, title and further link for all press releases from 2020 and summarise 
them in a tibble.

You can find the website at:
<https://www.landtag.brandenburg.de/de/aktuelles/presse/pressemitteilungsarchiv/archiv_pressemitteilungen_2020/980521>{target="_blank"}

### The query

Let's first look at the page in the browser and examine what happens when we 
click through the sub-pages. If we select the second sub-page, the URL in the
browser window changes. We see that the end of the URL is extended from "980521"
to "980521?skip=15". So a query is sent to the server and the corresponding 
sub-page is sent back and displayed. On the third sub-page, the query changes 
again to "980521?skip=30".

What could "skip=15" mean? If we look at the list of press releases, we see that
exactly 15 releases are displayed on each sub-page. We can therefore assume that
"skip=15" instructs the server to skip the first 15 releases and thus display 
entries 16-30. "skip=30" then skips the first 30 and so on. The principle can be
further confirmed by testing what "skip=0" triggers. The first sub-page is 
displayed again. So "980521" is actually functionally equivalent to 
"980521?skip=0".

With this we already know that we will be able to manipulate the URLs directly
from Rstudio and thus scrape the sub-pages.

### Scraping the sub-pages

Before we start scraping all the press releases, we first need to find out how 
many sub-pages there are. The easiest way would be to do this by eye. We can see
in the browser that the highest selectable sub-page is "12". But we can also find
this out in the scraping process itself. This has several advantages. We might
not only want to scrap the messages from 2020, but those from several or all
years. To do this, we would have to check for each year in the browser how many
sub-pages there are and adjust this accordingly. If we extract the page number in
the R code, this can be easily generalised to other years with different page 
numbers. If, on the other hand, the goal were to scrape the messages from 2021, 
we would have to check again whether the page number has changed every time we
repeat the process over the course of the year. By extracting it in the code, 
this step is eliminated and we can run the script regularly with minimal effort 
and be sure that it remains functional.

The links to the sub-pages, are contained in the HTML code in an unordered list 
(`<ul>`). The penultimate list element `<li>` contains the page number of the
last page, here "12". Please note that the last list element is the "Forward" 
button. With this information we can construct a selector and extract the page
number.

``` {r}
website <- "https://www.landtag.brandenburg.de/de/aktuelles/presse/pressemitteilungsarchiv/archiv_pressemitteilungen_2020/980521" %>% 
  read_html()

max <- website %>% 
  html_node(css = "ul.pagination.pagination-sm > li:nth-last-child(2)") %>% 
  html_text() %>% 
  as.numeric()
```

In the last line of code above, you again see the function `as.numeric()`.
Remember, that `html_text()` always returns a character vector. But since we 
need the value as a number to be able to calculate with it in R, we still have
to convert it into a number.

Now we can start constructing the links to all sub-pages directly in our R 
script. To do this, we need two components that we can then combine to create 
the URLs. First we have to define the constant part of the URL, the base URL. In
this case, this is the complete URL up to "?skip=" inclusive. In addition, we
need the values that are inserted after "?skip=". We can easily calculate these.
Each sub-page contains 15 press releases. So we can multiply the number of the 
sub-page by 15, but then we have to subtract another 15, because the 15 press 
releases shown on the current sub-page should not be skipped. So for page 1 we 
calculate: $1 ∗ 15 - 15 = 0$, for page 2: $2 ∗ 15 - 15 = 15$ and so on. To do 
this in one step for all sub-pages, we can use `1:max * 15 - 15` to instruct R to
repeat the calculation for all numbers from 1 to the maximum value -- which we
previously stored in the object `max`. `:` stands for "from-to". In this way we
get a numeric vector with the values for "?skip=". In the third step we can 
combine the base URL and the calculated values with `str_c()` to complete URLs
and parse them in the fourth step with `map()`.

``` {r}
base_url <- "https://www.landtag.brandenburg.de/de/aktuelles/presse/pressemitteilungsarchiv/archiv_pressemitteilungen_2020/980521?skip="

skips <- 1:max * 15 - 15
skips 

links <- str_c(base_url, skips)

pages <- links %>% 
  map(read_html)
```

Now we can extract the data we are interested in. Let's start with the date of 
the press release. This is enclosed by a `<p>` tag of the class `date`. With
`map()` we first select the corresponding nodes and in the next step extract the
text of these nodes. Since at this point a list of lists is returned, and this
would be unnecessarily complicated in further processing, we can use `unlist()`
to receive a character vector as output.

``` {r}
pages %>% 
  map(html_nodes, css = "p.date") %>% 
  map(html_text) %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  head(n = 5)
```

However, we can go one step further and store the data as a vector of the type 
"Date". This could be advantageous for potential further analyses. The tidyverse
package *lubridate* makes it easy to convert dates from character or numeric
vectors into the "Date" format. The package is not part of the core tidyverse 
and has to be loaded explicitly. Among other things, it offers a number of
functions in the form `dmy()`, `mdy()`, `ymd()` and so on. `d` stands for "day",
`m` for "month" and `y` for "year". With the order in which the letters appear
in the function name, we tell R which format the data we want to convert to the
"date" format has. On the website of the Brandenburg state parliament, the dates
are written in the form Day.Month.Year, which is typical in Germany. So we use
the function `dmy()`. If, for example, they were in the form Month.Day.Year, 
which is typical in the USA, we would have to use `mdy()` accordingly. It is
irrelevant whether the components of the date are separated with ".", "/", "-" 
or spaces. Even written out or abbreviated month names can be processed by
lubridate.

``` {r, message = FALSE}
library(lubridate)
```

```
test <- pages %>% 
  map(html_nodes, css = "p.date") %>% 
  map(html_text) %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  dmy() %>% 
  head(n = 5)
```

More about the handling of dates and times in R as well as the further 
possibilities opened up by lubridate, can be found in the corresponding chapter
in "R for Data Science":
<https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html>{target="_blank"}

Next, we can extract the titles of the press releases. By now you will be able 
to understand the code and the CSS selector for this yourself.

``` {r}
pages %>% 
  map(html_nodes, css = "p.result-name") %>% 
  map(html_text, trim = TRUE) %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  head(n = 5)
```

The last thing to extract, are the links to the individual messages. Here, too, 
nothing surprising happens at first.

``` {r}
pages %>% 
  map(html_nodes, css = "li.ce.ce-teaser > a") %>% 
  map(html_attr, name = "href") %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  head(n = 5)
```

But, the links stored in the HTML code only describe a part of the complete URL.
We could now construct the complete URLs again with `str_c()`. However, we still
need a new concept for this. The pipe passes the result of a step along to the
next line. If we use `str_c()` within the pipe, it receives the extracted end
part of the URLs as the first argument. 
`str_c("https://www.landtag.brandenburg.de")` would therefore lead to the end
part of the URL being appended before "https://www.landtag.brandenburg.de".
However, logically we want this to happen the other way round. To do this, we
need to tell `str_c()`, to use the data passed through the pipe as the second
argument. We can achieve this by using `.`. `.` stands for the data passed 
through the pipe. This way we can combine the URLs correctly:

``` {r}
pages %>% 
  map(html_nodes, css = "li.ce.ce-teaser > a") %>% 
  map(html_attr, name = "href") %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  str_c("https://www.landtag.brandenburg.de", .) %>% 
  head(n = 5)
```

As always, we can perform the complete extraction of the data during the 
construction of a tibble:

``` {r}
tibble(
  date = pages %>% 
    map(html_nodes, css = "p.date") %>% 
    map(html_text) %>% 
    unlist() %>% 
    dmy(),
  name = pages %>% 
    map(html_nodes, css = "p.result-name") %>% 
    map(html_text, trim = TRUE) %>% 
    unlist(),
  link = pages %>% 
    map(html_nodes, css = "li.ce.ce-teaser > a") %>% 
    map(html_attr, name = "href") %>% 
    unlist() %>% 
    str_c("https://www.landtag.brandenburg.de", .)
)
```
